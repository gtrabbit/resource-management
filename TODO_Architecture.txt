Need to move on toward enabling the upgrading of citizens

constructing buildings

daily/random events

can add a concept of time-- events taking X number of turns to complete-- expeditions, buildings, etc?

Consider migrating to an actual build system (webpack/babel w/ Grunt?) -- thus, an npm background, which will need to come eventually anyway if we're going to have persistence

Build UI components --- I suppose I should wait on Barry before I bother with that, though? yes. everything can look like crap for now.
                        but down the road, I should definitely abstract UI into reusable/atomic classes


    ============= Saving ============

-- want to minimize the amount of data needed to regenerate the exact game state.
-- need not pass any logic

-- if we want to consider saving a possibility, then we will need the game object to be able to track which events have triggered / how many times.
